\item Empowerment \& development: a focus on believing that with the
  appropriate dedication and practice we can attain any skills and
  knowledge we desire.
\item Value and promote diversity: a diversity backgrounds and experiences is essential
  for the progression of science.
\item Collaboration: community and collaboration are key to sustaining
  success in scholarly inquiry. We will collaborate both within the
  lab and with external individuals.
\item Collegiality \& humanity: a healthy community is one in which
  collegiality, respect, kindness and empathy are guiding principles
\item Sharing: data, code, etc., should be shared whenever possible,
  in ways that enable reuse and discovery.
