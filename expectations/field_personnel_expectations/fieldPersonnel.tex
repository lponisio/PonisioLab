\section{PI (Lauren)}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item forward the professional interests of the members of the field
  crew through mentoring and eventually writing letters and making
  connections 
\item promote all members of the field in having a positive, enriching
  field experience
\item foster and encourage an atmosphere of inclusivity, exploration,
  learning, and good communication, and a positive, safe work
  environment while in the field
\item set scientific methodology, and be available to discuss
  methodology and problem solve/modify if necessary (often remotely)

\item promptly respond to concerns from field personnel via email or phone when issues arise throughout the field season
\end{enumerate}


\section{Field leads}
\begin{enumerate}
\item be present with a positive spirit
\item coordinate activities of the field crew including field days,
  off days, and lab days
\item organize daily check ins with field crew including:

  \item equitable assignment of tasks to memebers of the crew
  \item Led ``house disucssion'' ever two weeks to discuss camping,
    field station living situation
  \end{itemize}
\item Check in with each individual crew member alone with the same
  questions you ask the larger group each week
\item communicate with PI weekly about how the crew is doing from group
  and individual meetings
\item All improvisations on schedule/methods must be okayed by field
  leader with an eye to how any changes will affect the project

  modifications
\item coordinate with PIs about any conflicts/issues regarding personnel
\item assign duties to others as they deem appropriate

  heat, bugs, horses, cattle, bulls, bears, weird humans, etc.)
\item take care of self and communicate problems/concerns when
  necessary
\item conduct themselves in a professional and safe manner
\item fill out timesheets and send to PI before the $15^{th}$ of each month

\end{enumerate}


\section{Field Technician}
\begin{enumerate}
\item be present with a positive spirit
\item take care of self and communicate problems/concerns when
  necessary
\item prepare personal and field items in accordance with set schedule
\item try your best to problem solve and improvise and checking in
  with the field leader
\item collect/record/digitize/preserve high quality field data to
  ensure high quality science
\item conduct themselves in a professional and safe manner
\item maintain field equipment (batteries, net tears etc.), and keep
  track of field equipment
\item fill out timesheets and send to PI before the $15^{th}$ of each month
\item be aware that schedule is tentative and may change due to weather or other circumstances 
\item make sure that any writing (labels on tubes/datasheets) is legible to someone else because chances are you won't be the person processing the bees down the line 
\item whether staying at a field station or camping, clean up after yourself and contribute to group cleaning tasks to maintain a hospitable environment (i.e. taking out trash, cleaning dishes for group meals, sweeping floors, tidying and organizing shared spaces)
\item fill out data sheets completely, do not leave blanks where there should be zeros or NAs
\item if conflict arises with field lead or field supervisor, promptly contact PI via email or phone to handle mediation. any feelings of discomfort should be communicated to PI as soon as they are noticed, so that interventions can be made to preserve the comfort and safety of all team members.
