\section{Buying things}
\begin{enumerate}
\item all purchases should go through Leah, use the request form and
  email to Ecology and Evolution Program <ecolevol@uoregon.edu>
  \item you can buy things (i.e., at costco) and keep the receipt to
    get reimbused. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Travel}
\begin{enumerate}
\item use \href{https://ba.uoregon.edu/travel/concur}
  {Connexus} for travel, Leah can make sure you are doing it right and you
  don't have to pay out of pocket for flights. Tips:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item it takes a while to get access, ask early. If you don't get
    it worked out in time, have someone with access book a guest
    ticket for you.
    \item You must make a request request, the PI/Leah will approve
      it, then you can book travel. 
  \item it clears all reservations at midnight unless Leah approves
    them, so book during buisness hours.
  \item rental cars and hotels cannot be booked directly on an index, you have to pay out
    of pocket and be reimbused. Contracts use UO rates and insurnace
    so yours is not primary. Never book a rental car without using
    the UO rate.
  \item you can use a personal car ($0.55$ a mile), but you need to
    prove it is cheaper than flying (or a reason for why you cannot
    fly)
    \item Leah can book conference registration fees on the IEE credit
      card to avoid paying out of pocket. 
  \end{enumerate}      
\end{enumerate}

\section{Avoiding paying out of pockets}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item use connexus for flights and book directly on an the IEE card
\item apply for a travel card. For multi-year people only. Expect it
  to take a month to receive.
\item ask for a travel fund forwarding at least 30 days in
  advance. This is a lot of work for everyone and should only be
  used in emergencies. 
\end{enumerate}
